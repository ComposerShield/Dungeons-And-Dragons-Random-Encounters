# Dungeons and Dragons Random Encounter Generator

## So what is this?   
This app is literally just for my friends and I to generate random encounters in Dungeons and Dragons (3.5).
It generates parties of monsters with randomized stats, weapons, and even characteristics.
It is cross-platform (Mac, Windows, IOS, and Android) using Juce.

## Getting started
- Clone
- Open .jucer file in Projucer. Launch in XCode, Visual Studio, or Android Studio.
- Build.
