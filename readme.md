What is this?   
    This app is literally just for my friends and I to generate random encounters in Dungeons and Dragons 3.5
    It generates parties of monsters with randomized stats, weapons, and even characteristics.
    It's cross-platform (Mac, Windows, IOS, and Android) using Juce.

Getting started
    1. Clone
    2. Open .jucer file in Projucer. Launch in XCode, Visual Studio, or Android Studio.
    3. Build.
